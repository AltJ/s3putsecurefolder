s3putsecurefolder.py
--------------------

Full discussion & background: http://www.stevestreeting.com/2009/08/02/s3-encrypted-upload-script-v2-python/

Syncs the contents of a folder to Amazon S3, optionally encrypting the files with GPG beforehand.

Each file is individually encrypted either with a public key of a private/public pair, or
using a simple symmetric passphrase. Therefore you can still get to each file separately
on S3, but would need to decrypt it to view the original contents.

Determines which files to sync based on the MD5 hash of the unencrypted contents, which 
is stored as metadata on the S3 side. This is more reliable than using date/time stamps
due to the distributed nature and that these stamps are changed when encrypting files.

This script never deletes any files on S3, it only creates or updates, making it suitable for
backup purposes. Feel free to add a --delete option if you like ;)

Authentication with S3 is either via explicit parameters (--accesskey, --secretkey), or
you can define environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY.

Requirements
------------

Python 2.7+
Boto (easy_install boto)
GPG (if encrypting)

Tested on Mac and Linux, probably works on Windows too. Maybe.


Usage
-----

Usage: s3putsecurefolder.py [options] source_folder target_bucket [gpg_recipient_or_phrase]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --dry-run         Do not upload any files, just list actions
  -a ACCESS_KEY, --accesskey=ACCESS_KEY
                        AWS access key to use instead of relying on
                        environment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY
  -s SECRET_KEY, --secretkey=SECRET_KEY
                        AWS secret key to use instead of relying on
                        environment variable AWS_SECRET_KEY
  -c, --create          Create bucket if it does not already exist
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output
  -S, --symmetric       Instead of encrypting with a public key, encrypts
                        files using a symmetric cypher and the passphrase
                        given on the command-line.
  -X, --exclude         Exclude a file or wildcard pattern (may be listed more than once)
  -D, --disableencryption
                        Do not encrypt files before upload.
